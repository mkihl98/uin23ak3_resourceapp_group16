# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Group members:

## Links used

https://lms.webtricks.blog/kurs/uin/react-navigasjon-og-layout

We also used a lot of stuff from class and went back to look at previosu work done. 

## Work distributed

Martine M, main focus, layout and route
Martine R, main focus, components and scss
Philip, main focus, components

We all worked together on everything but mainly did what we had or focus on. We used the scss from the Martines. The main work was done on one computer and then later on compiled together into a repository making the adjustment that were needed.
